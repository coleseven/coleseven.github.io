    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Cole Jones and I am currently getting my Masters degree in Computer Science from University of South Carolina Beaufort. If you are viewing this after March 2026, I will have graduated. I am very interested in Astronomy/Astrophysics, Cyber Security and Machine Learning. Outside of computer work I enjoy doing woodworking projects and lapidary projects. I am also beginning to learn how to clone/propagate plants. </p>
