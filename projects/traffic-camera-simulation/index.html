    <h1>Traffic Camera Simulation</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This project explores polling strategies for large-scale traffic camera systems.
        The goal was to reduce duplicate image downloads, minimize bandwidth usage,
        and avoid missing images under real-world timing constraints.
    </p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
        Polling dozens of cameras at fixed intervals leads to inefficiencies such as
        duplicate images, wasted bandwidth, and synchronization issues.
    </p>

    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>
        I built simulation models using Monte Carlo techniques to compare different
        polling strategies, including staggered polling and conditional requests.
    </p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
        The simulations demonstrated measurable reductions in duplicate downloads
        and improved bandwidth efficiency under realistic timing distributions.
