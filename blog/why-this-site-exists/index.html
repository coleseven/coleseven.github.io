    <h1>Why This Site Exists</h1>

    <p><em>Posted on: 2025-12-29</em></p>

    <p>
        This blog exists as a career-oriented archive of the work I have done
        in cybersecurity, machine learning, programming, simulation, and related technical fields.
    </p>

    <p>
        Rather than isolated projects or disconnected repositories, this site
        is intended to show how I think, how I approach problems, and how projects
        evolve over time.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each project page documents not just outcomes, but goals, tradeoffs,
        and lessons learned along the way.
    </p>

    <p>
        This site will continue to grow as new projects are added.
